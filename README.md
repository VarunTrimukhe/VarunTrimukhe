- 👋 Hi, I’m @VarunTrimukhe
- I’m a passionate student at IIT Madras,  currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BS) Degree in Data Science and Applications. My journey here has been exhilarating, and I’ve had the privilege of learning from some of the brightest minds in the field.

- 🌐 Beyond academics, I wear multiple hats. As a digital enthusiast, I specialize in creating stunning websites using platforms like Wix, WordPress, and Google Sites. Whether it’s a sleek business site or a personal blog, I love turning ideas into pixel-perfect reality.

- 🎨 Logos are my canvas. Crafting a visual identity that resonates with your brand is my forte. From minimalist elegance to bold and vibrant designs, I’ve got you covered.

- 🎥 Video editing is where my creativity truly shines. I’ve honed my skills in cutting-edge software, transforming raw footage into captivating stories. And yes, my YouTube channel is a testament to my passion for cars—each video meticulously crafted to engage and entertain.

- 🧩 When I’m not immersed in pixels and videos, I’m solving Rubik’s cubes of all sizes—2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and even the mind-bending mirror cubes. Puzzle-solving keeps my brain sharp!

- ♟️ And let’s not forget chess—I’m a strategic thinker who enjoys the mental gymnastics of the game. Whether it’s a classic match or a blitz game, I’m up for the challenge.

- 🚀 But here’s the heart of it all: small businesses. My mission is simple—to empower them with top-notch digital solutions. I believe that quality need not come at a hefty price tag. So, whether you’re a startup, a local shop, or an aspiring entrepreneur, I’m here to elevate your online presence without breaking the bank.
